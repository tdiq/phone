# Audio and Interaction Flow

## Audio System
- Audio handling is primarily managed in [modules/Handset.py](mdc:modules/Handset.py)
- Audio files are played sequentially based on user interactions
- Speech detection is performed during specific audio playback segments

## Interaction Sequence
1. System starts and waits for OSC `/props/phone/start` message
2. Phone rings once when start message is received
3. When handset is picked up:
   - System sends `/props/phone/pickup` OSC message
   - Plays introduction audio
   - Listens for user response
4. Based on user's speech/silence:
   - Sends appropriate OSC message (`/props/phone/user_spoke` or `/props/phone/user_silent`)
   - Plays subsequent audio files in sequence
5. When handset is hung up:
   - Sends `/props/phone/hangup` OSC message
   - Stops any ongoing audio playback

## Audio Assets
Audio files are stored in `assets/dialogue/` with numbered prefixes indicating playback order:
- 1_child_have-to-whisper.wav
- 2-you-remember-dont-you.wav
- 3-happy-birthday-spell.wav
- 4-always-listening.wav
