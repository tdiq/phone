# TDIQ Phone Project Overview

This is a Python-based interactive phone prop system that combines hardware control with audio playback and speech detection capabilities. The system uses OSC (Open Sound Control) for communication with a control PC.

## Main Components

- [app.py](mdc:app.py): The main entry point and application controller
- [modules/Phone.py](mdc:modules/Phone.py): Core phone hardware control
- [modules/Handset.py](mdc:modules/Handset.py): Handles audio playback and recording
- [modules/RotaryDial.py](mdc:modules/RotaryDial.py): Controls rotary dial functionality
- [modules/OSC.py](mdc:modules/OSC.py): Manages OSC communication

## Key Features

1. Phone hardware control (pickup/hangup detection)
2. Audio playback and recording
3. Speech detection during playback
4. OSC communication with control PC
5. Rotary dial input processing

## Configuration

The system connects to a control PC at a configured IP address (default: 10.0.0.45) and uses various audio assets stored in the assets directory for playback.
