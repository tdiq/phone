# Code Conventions and Patterns

## Class Structure
- Classes use PascalCase naming (e.g., `TDIQPhone`, `Phone`, `OSCHandler`)
- Instance methods use snake_case (e.g., `on_pick_up_phone`, `handle_user_spoke`)
- Callback methods are typically prefixed with `on_` or `handle_`

## Error Handling
- Critical operations are wrapped in try-except blocks
- Graceful shutdown handlers are implemented for SIGTERM and SIGINT
- Logging is used extensively for debugging and monitoring

## Dependencies
- Core dependencies are managed in [requirements.txt](mdc:requirements.txt)
- External dependencies include:
  - pygame for audio handling
  - python-osc for OSC communication

## Resource Management
- Hardware resources are properly initialized and cleaned up
- Audio files are stored in the assets directory
- Configuration values are defined at the module level
